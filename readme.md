## The url of your deployed website on heroku (e.g., something-something.herokuapp.com)
https://shrouded-brushlands-73706.herokuapp.com/

## What additional piece(s) of information about a url your previewer gets and displays. Also copy in a url that we can use to see it work
I put in a feature that checks if the site tracks your interacitons using Facebook Pixel.
Test URL: https://acadarena.com

## What visual style change(s) you made on the url preview html, and why you think that is an improvement (this can be short, like just one sentence)
I made the card dark to make the card stand out. Added a margin to make it less cramped.

## The names of other students who helped
None for this one. Thomas helped me learn during lecture, though! As well as general syntax and such fron StackOverflow.
